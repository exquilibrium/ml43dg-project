# DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation
## Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (IN2392) -- Final Project
We propose the following modifications to the DeepSDF architecture:

1. Extend generalization by adding more shape classes
2. Texture the shape representation by using an additional latent vector
3. Use multiple forward and backward passes to improve test time optimization

The entrypoint for the code implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/exquilibrium/ml43dg-project/blob/main/DeepSDF-exercise/ml43dg_project.ipynb).
